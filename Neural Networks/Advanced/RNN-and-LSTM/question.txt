Can you develop an RNN model that accurately predicts the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of movie reviews?

Dataset:

The IMDb movie review dataset is a large collection of movie reviews from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) that have been labeled with their corresponding sentiment (positive or negative). This dataset is widely used for sentiment analysis tasks and is a good benchmark for evaluating the performance of your RNN model.

Additional Considerations:
- Data Preprocessing: Before training your RNN model, you will need to preprocess the text data. This may involve removing punctuation, converting words to lowercase, and tokenizing the text.
- Model Architecture: You can experiment with different RNN architectures, such as LSTM or GRU, to find the best model for this task.
- Evaluation Metrics: You can use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the performance of your model.
- This task will allow you to explore the capabilities of RNNs for natural language processing and sentiment analysis. Good luck!
