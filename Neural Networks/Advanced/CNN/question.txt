Question:

You are tasked with designing a Convolutional Neural Network for a simple image classification problem. 
The dataset divided into two classes: Cats and Dogs.

Your CNN architecture includes:

- An input layer for the grayscale images.
- Two convolutional layers, each followed by a ReLU activation function.
- Max-pooling layers to reduce the spatial dimensions.
- A fully connected layer for classification.
- A softmax layer for output probabilities.

Answer the following:

- What are the roles of the convolutional layers and the max-pooling layers in this architecture?

- If the first convolutional layer uses a kernel size of 3×3 with a stride of 1 and no padding, what will be the output dimensions after the first convolutional layer if 16 filters are applied?

- If a 2×2 max-pooling layer is applied after the first convolutional layer, what will be the output dimensions?

- How does the use of ReLU activation function help in this architecture?

- Suggest a suitable optimizer and loss function for training this network on the given dataset and explain why.
