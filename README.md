# Alex's ML Learning (veunex/learning)

This repository contains all the code and notes I've written while learning about machine learning (still in progress, lol). I'm using Python and Jupyter Notebooks for this.

    - Simple Linear Regression (from scratch)
    - Multiple Linear Regression (from scratch)
    - Simple Linear Regression (using `sklearn`)
    - Multiple Linear Regression (using `sklearn`)
 
- Logistic Regression
    - Binary Logistic Regression (from scratch)
    - Binary Logistic Regression (using `sklearn`)
    - Multiclass Logistic Regression (from scratch)
    - Multiclass Logistic Regression (using `sklearn`)

- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
    - SVM (from scratch)
    - SVM (using `sklearn`)

- K-Means Clustering
    - K-Means Clustering (from scratch)
    - K-Means Clustering (using `sklearn`)
